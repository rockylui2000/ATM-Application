# ATM-Application

A simple bank ATM simulator

# Description of Project:

This is a simple banking ATM application built with React. The way this app works is simple. First, you select an action either "Deposit" or Cash Back". Cash Back means withdrawl from the bank account. Then, you enter an amount in the text field. After that, you hit the submit button. The application will add or substract your bank balance beased on your input. This ATM application has a built-in feature to prevent you from overdraft in your account. If your account balance is less than the "Cash Back" amount, it will not let you submit.

# How to Run:

You can download all the files & folders to your local folder. Open terminal app and type http-server -c-1. Open your browser and type localhost:8080 to view the application.

# Roadmap of future improvements:

I plan to add more functionalities similar to a real bank ATM.
